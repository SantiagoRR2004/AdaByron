# Ada Byron

## Overview

This is a project for the Ada Byron [competition](https://www.ada-byron.es/). The goal is to create a program that can solve a given problem. Each problem is given a set of examples that are added in the test files that need to pass.

## Contributing

To contribute you need to create a fork of this repository that is named as the problem you are solving. Right now there are multiple branches that are solving different problems. You need have the pull request solve the tests that are given with the problem and guarantee that it passes the tests of the platform [aceptaelreto](https://aceptaelreto.com/) when it is translated to a valid language, if it is one of their challenges.

Create a separate fork for each problem. This is to avoid merge conflicts and to make it easier to review the code.

To solve each problem create the corresponding file and test with the names that follow the given naming conventions.

If you want to add a new PDF with problems of different events just create a fork with the right name and just add the PDF.

Another way to contribute is by sending to this [url](https://aceptaelreto.com/doc/contact.php) that you want the online program to support the Python language.

## Advanced Contributing

You could enable other programming languages (Java, C and C++) to work with tests automatically with Visual Studio Code.

A method to send the file with the program to the online platform to check if it is correct or not. This would require the username and password for the login. Right now this would only work for Java, C and C++ files because of the platform.

In the docs folder there is a dossier. You need to ask for access to the Drive file. This is a file to take to events with the most important algorithms and their implementations. If you are able to improve this file please do so.
